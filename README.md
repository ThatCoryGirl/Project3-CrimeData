# Project3-CrimeData

# **Data Visualization Track**

For this track, your group will tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

Your project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:

Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)

JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)

A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class

Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).

Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.

Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:

HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:

JavaScript libraries

Python in Jupyter Notebook

Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally

Remember: You have learned how to filter data in Pandas, JavaScript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB.

If possible, your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

# **Data Engineering Track**

For this track, your group will follow data engineering processes. Here are the specific requirements:

Data must be stored in a SQL or NoSQL database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc) and the database must include at least two tables (SQL) or collections (NoSQL).

The database must contain at least 100 records.

Your project must use ETL workflows to ingest data into the database (i.e. the data should not be exactly the same as the original source; it should have been transformed in some way).

Your project must include a method for reading data from the database and displaying it for future use, such as:

Pandas DataFrame

Flask API with JSON output

Your project must use one additional library not covered in class related to data engineering. Consider libraries for data streaming, cloud, data pipelines, or data validation.

Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:

An overview of the project and its purpose

Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

Documentation of the database used and why (e.g. benefits of SQL or NoSQL for this project)

ETL workflow with diagrams or ERD

At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

References for the data source(s)

References for any code used that is not your own

OPTIONAL: add user-driven interaction, either before or after the ETL process. e.g.:

BEFORE: provide a menu of options for the user to narrow the range of data being extracted from a data source (e.g. API or CSV file, where fields are known in advance).

AFTER: Once the data is stored in the database, add user capability to extract filtered data from the database prior to loading it in a Pandas DataFrame or a JSON output from a Flask API.
