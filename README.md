# Project3-CrimeData

# **Data Visualization Track**

For this track, your group will tell a story using data visualizations. Here are the specific requirements:

  - Your project must include visualizations. The visualizations can be created with:

    - Python (e.g. Matplotlib, Pandas plotting, hvplot)

    - JavaScript (e.g. Plotly or Leaflet)

    - A Python or JavaScript visualization library that was not covered in class

  - Data must be stored in and extracted from at least one database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, SQLite, etc).

  - Your project must include at least one JavaScript OR Python library that we did not cover.

  - Your project must be powered by a dataset with at least 100 records.

  - Your project must include some level of user-driven interaction, such as:

    - HTML menus, dropdowns, and/or textboxes to display JavaScript-powered visualizations

    - Flask backend with interactive API routes that serve back Python or JavaScript created plots

    - Visualizations created from user-selected filtered data, which could be powered by:

      - JavaScript libraries

      - Python in Jupyter Notebook
      
      - Command-line Python scripts that save visualizations locally

      **Remember**: You have learned how to filter data in Pandas, JavaScript, SQL, SQLAlchemy, and MongoDB.

  - If possible, your final visualization should ideally include at least three views.

  - Your GitHub repo must include a README.md with an outline of the project including:

    - An overview of the project and its purpose

    - Instructions on how to use and interact with the project

    - At least one paragraph summarizing efforts for ethical considerations made in the project

    - References for the data source(s)

    - References for any code used that is not your own
