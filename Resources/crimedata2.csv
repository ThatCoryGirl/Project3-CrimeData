"Source: National Safety Council analysis of National Center for Health (NCHS)--Mortality Data for 1999-2020, as compiled from data provided by the 57 vital statistics jurisdictions through the Vital Statistics Cooperative Program. Deaths are classified using the International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision. Preventable drug poisoning deaths are identified using underlying cause-of-death codes X40-X44, while all drug poisoning deaths are identified by codes X40-X44, X60-X64, X85, and Y10-Y14. Among deaths with drug overdose as the underlying cause, the following multiple cause-of-death codes indicate the drug type(s) involved: Any opioid (T4NR-T40.4, T40.6), heroin (T40.1), methadone (T40.3), synthetic opioids other than methadone (including fentanyl, T40.4), natural and semisynthetic opioids (including oxycodone and hydrocodone, T40.2), benzodiazepines (T42.4), cocaine (T40.5), and cannabis (T40.7). Deaths involving more than one opioid category are counted in both categories. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
